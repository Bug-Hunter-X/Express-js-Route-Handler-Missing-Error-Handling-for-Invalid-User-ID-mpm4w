# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, this example shows a route that fetches a user by ID but lacks proper handling if the ID is not a valid integer.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  It attempts to parse the user ID as an integer but doesn't handle the case where `req.params.id` is not a number, which can lead to a runtime error or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code. It includes error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs, returning a 404 status code if the user is not found or if the ID is invalid.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive input validation and error handling in Express.js applications to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected failures.
